**Real-time Micro-Climate Forecasting & Anomaly Detection for Hyper-Local Regions**

MicroClimate is an AI-powered platform designed to monitor, forecast, and analyze **hyper-local weather and climate conditions** at a **1–5 km spatial resolution** — far more granular than traditional city-level forecasts. By combining live atmospheric data, machine learning models, and anomaly detection, MicroClimate provides actionable insights and early risk signals for communities, planners, and researchers.

## 🚀 Motivation

Most weather platforms provide coarse-grained forecasts that fail to capture **neighborhood-level variations** caused by urban density, terrain, vegetation, and localized weather phenomena.

MicroClimate bridges this gap by enabling:

* **Localized climate intelligence**
* **Early detection of abnormal weather patterns**
* **Risk-aware decision making** for smart cities, agriculture, and disaster preparedness

## ✨ Key Features

### 🌡️ Real-Time Weather Intelligence

* Live ingestion of atmospheric data:

  * Temperature
  * Humidity
  * Pressure
  * Wind speed & direction
* Powered by trusted public weather APIs

### 📍 Hyper-Local Geo Support

* High-precision latitude/longitude-based tracking
* Reverse geocoding to identify the user’s **neighborhood or locality**
* Dynamic location-based weather updates

### 📊 Time-Series Forecasting

* Short-term forecasting using ML-based time-series models (e.g., Prophet)
* Visualized trend predictions for upcoming hours/days
* Adaptive to changing patterns over time

### 🚨 Anomaly Detection Engine

* Detects sudden or unusual climate deviations
* Flags potential risks such as:

  * Sudden temperature spikes/drops
  * Abnormal humidity or pressure changes
* Designed for early warning and monitoring systems

### ⚠️ Risk Scoring System

* Aggregates anomalies and forecast deviations
* Generates a **risk score** indicating potential threat levels
* Useful for decision-making and alerting pipelines

### 🌍 Interactive 3D Visualization

* 3D Earth-based visualization using **Three.js**
* Intuitive and immersive exploration of climate conditions
* Designed for clarity, education, and insight discovery
